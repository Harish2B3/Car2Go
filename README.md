This is a half built website/project that is used to extract the car specifications data from a well-know website that gradually updates the car models and its variations.
(The reason behind extracting the cars data from others website is we dont have enough database for this project).
so instead of using others data we can modify this project to our own database using mysql or any other prefered db.
we used node js, html, css, bootstrap and hbs in creating this project.
